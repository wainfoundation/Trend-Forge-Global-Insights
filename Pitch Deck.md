📄 Trend Forge | MrWain Organization
Venture Funding Proposal
Date: \[5/17/25]

🔷 About Trend Forge
Trend Forge is a pioneering decentralized insights platform under the MrWain nonprofit organization. Designed for the Pi Network ecosystem, it empowers users to discover and act on global trends across business, technology, society, and culture. Through crowdsourced intelligence, gamified data contribution, and Pi-based rewards, we offer a next-generation experience for understanding what’s trending—powered by the people.

As part of the MrWain Organization, we share a mission to develop ethical, inclusive, and impactful digital applications for the Pi ecosystem and beyond.

✅ Long-Term Vision
Trend Forge is committed to growing alongside the Pi Network. As Pi evolves, so will our tools, insights, and services. We envision a robust network of Pi-powered apps where Trend Forge serves as the intelligence layer guiding communities and businesses into the future.

🔷 Purpose of This Proposal
We are seeking funding support from Pi Network Ventures, ecosystem builders, and mission-aligned partners who believe in the value of decentralized knowledge systems. This proposal outlines our project vision and how any voluntary support will help sustain and scale Trend Forge.

🔷 Important Disclaimers
Trend Forge is part of MrWain, a nonprofit organization. We:

* Do not offer equity, tokens, or financial returns for contributions
* Cannot guarantee 100% success, but will commit fully to our goals
* Will not treat contributions as loans or promise payback
* Recognize that all support is at-risk, voluntary, and based on shared belief in the Pi ecosystem

We cannot define the exact amount needed upfront. Final funding decisions rest solely with the Pi Core Team and will be based on their internal criteria and risk assessments.

🔷 Use of Funds
Funding will be used to support the complete development lifecycle and sustainability of Trend Forge. This includes:

* DApp Development (UI/UX, frontend/backend, testing)
* Developer & Analyst Salaries
* Trend Intelligence Engine Infrastructure
* Hosting, APIs, Cloud Services
* Community Incentives & Pi Rewards
* Ecosystem Integrations
* Legal, Administrative, and Compliance Costs
* Planned Office Setup (as we scale)

All use of funds will be tracked and communicated through periodic community updates and transparent reports.

🔷 Our Vision
Trend Forge aims to become the intelligence backbone of the Pi Network—where every user has access to meaningful, real-time insights. We believe decentralized data is the future, and together with Pi Network, we can make that future a reality.
